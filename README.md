# EC414_MachineLearning
A collection of Machine Learning assignments from EC414, Spring 2024.
EC414 is a comprehensive class engaging in ML topics from linear regression, gradient descent, nearest neighbors to neural networks and backpropagation.
Mathemetically rigorous with a focus on implementation, it provided me with great intuition for ML application.
