# SDK(Sadman Kabir) ML repo.
A collection of Machine Learning assignments from my ML courses, starting Spring 2024.
Fortunate to have taken a comprehensive class engaging in ML topics from linear regression, gradient descent, nearest neighbors to neural networks and backpropagation.
Mathemetically rigorous with a focus on implementation, it provided me with great intuition for ML application.
